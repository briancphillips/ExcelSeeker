✅ Real-time search results display
✅ Clean and responsive user interface
✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
✅ Native folder selection dialog
✅ Progress tracking for folder searches
✅ Dark mode support
✅ Optimized search filtering with debouncing
✅ Automatic service management
✅ Graceful error handling for corrupted files
✅ Partial results on search cancellation

## Technical Stack Implementation

✅ **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
✅ **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
✅ **File Processing**: xlrd library for Excel file handling
✅ **Development Environment**: Python virtual environment
✅ **Folder Selection**: Electron service with always-on-top dialog
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
✅ **Performance**: Debounced filtering, result caching
✅ **Service Management**: Automatic service startup and cleanup
✅ **Search Control**: Cancellation with partial results display
