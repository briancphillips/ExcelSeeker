# ExcelSeeker: Excel File Search Portal

## Project Overview

ExcelSeeker is a web-based application that allows users to search through Excel (.xls) files for specific text strings. The application provides a simple, user-friendly interface for uploading Excel files and performing text searches across all cells.

## Core Features

- ✅ File upload capability for .xls files
- ✅ Text search functionality across all cells in Excel files
- ✅ Real-time search results display
- ✅ Clean and responsive user interface
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Folder-based search capability

## Technical Stack Implementation

- ✅ **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- ✅ **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- ✅ **File Processing**: xlrd library for Excel file handling
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Python virtual environment
