# ExcelSeeker: Excel File Search Portal

## Project Overview

ExcelSeeker is a web-based application that allows users to search through Excel (.xls) files for specific text strings. The application provides a simple, user-friendly interface for uploading Excel files and performing text searches across all cells.

## Core Features

✅ File upload capability for .xls files
✅ Text search functionality across all cells in Excel files
✅ Real-time search results display
✅ Clean and responsive user interface
✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
✅ Native folder selection dialog
✅ Progress tracking for folder searches
✅ Dark mode support

## Technical Stack Implementation

✅ **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
✅ **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
✅ **File Processing**: xlrd library for Excel file handling
✅ **Development Environment**: Python virtual environment
✅ **Folder Selection**: Electron service with always-on-top dialog
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates

## Project Structure

✅ Basic structure implemented:
