âœ… **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
âœ… **File Processing**: xlrd library for Excel file handling
âœ… **Development Environment**: Python virtual environment
âœ… **Folder Selection**: Electron service with always-on-top dialog
âœ… **Progress Tracking**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
âœ… **Performance**: Debounced filtering, result caching
âœ… **Service Management**: Automatic service startup and cleanup
âœ… **Search Control**: Cancellation with partial results display
âœ… **Process Management**: Robust process cleanup and port handling
